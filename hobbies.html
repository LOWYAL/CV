          I have no preferences when it comes to food. I can basically eat anything. I've noticed that a lot of people are very picky with food especially when it comes to meat.<br />
      I can eat any type of meat. Because of my love for diveristy in food I've decided to be a tourist when I can fend for myself. I plan to travel around the world and eat the<br />
      native meals of as many places I go to. Talking about eating anything, I don't eat everything. I do mostly binge eating. I don't eat much at all which is why i find myself being<br />
      hungry everytime. For this reason and more, I am quite skinny ...how did I get to divert so much, pardon me. I love eating cake. I don't know if that could qualify as my best food<br />
      I know, I know, i'ts a dessert, sadly.
